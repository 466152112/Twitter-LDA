This is n't that much different than the stuff they do on Wipeout . Where 's John Anderson ?
Water ?
Roy Oswalt would have looked good in a uniform .

Doris pushing people out of the way like nobody 's business !
What is KG doing to Pietrus ?
ESPN announcers doing everything but throwing broken mirrors out there at Allen

I 'm at a little league benefit listening to the band play Sweet Caroline
