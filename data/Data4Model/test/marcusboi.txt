God I just spent all my money on eroge .
Thanks !
where about is your booth in artist 's alley ?
If only I had any idea how to get past the PSO2 launcher ... lol .
Whoa now what where is this
This should be good , right ? Has the email header and a fair bit of the contents .
If you want I can take a screenshot of the email . And it does n't matter to me if there 's sourcing or not sourcing .
That 's what happens when you take an 8-hour mega course .
We all went to nutritional school while you were sleeping .
Do you get Atlus emails ? Their latest one was titled `` CoP a feel of these goods ! '' for the DS game Code of Princess .
At least enough to not realize that using `` female '' that way is n't exactly the coolest thing to do .
I found that super odd myself . They seem to have read up on male gaze somewhat , but not other surrounding issues ?
This is scary .
They all just sort of cover the same themes , but they are n't actually connected . So they 're all about like tech + communication
How CALM or WORKED UP do you feel ?
How do soundtracks work on Steam ? Do they just give you some MP3s downloaded into your Steam folder ?
At least if you 're weirded out by the prospect of `` dating '' that 's not really a big part of it . Very little if you do n't try playful
Personally I really liked it . You can check out the tracks here :
In other news , awesome to see your game as a daily deal ! Hope you can share details about how much of an impact that makes
To be fair , the past two sales were on the last Thursday of June . However , Valve ca n't seem to count to three ...
A Hate Story on sale on Steam when some people expected the sale . I 'm loving how purposeful this see Ms
NO
With your mouth
Oh man , Pyrovision .
Me too ! If you do give it a go then I hope you tweet about how good\/bad you find it grin .
Wow , thanks for retweeting that Ars article . I use Netflix subtitling whenever possible and by themselves they 'll never upgrade :
I 'm not a heathen !
Baconator ?
I wish these special modes in DDR did n't force you to do increasingly ridiculous tasks .
You and me both ! And probably every other Steam sale purchaser , lol .
Well that 's a bit odd . Downloading it lol .
The Kinect game ?
I ca n't believe I ever stopped playing DDR .
Because they are STUPID . Maybe someday they 'll do away with region locks ... or just find a worse way to do them disgust
Now youknow what my life is like smile
Yeah , I get you . Why do companies even still region lock ? We have the internet and import shops and everything .
So wait , P4 Golden IS N'T coming to Europe ? WHY ?
Gosh you Europeans why do n't you just import EVERYTHING ? Like youknow that one time us Americans imported Xenoblade .
That 's what I was remembering . Silly . Thank you for your help smile .
I ca n't remember . Is the Vita system region locked ? All I recall is the fuss of using multiple PSN accounts on it .
Wow . M.U.L.E. tribute Kickstarter just made me really sad .
There 's a game with that title , yeah , although it 's not exactly what you described .
Beat 'Em and amp ; Eat 'Em ?
Well Land Before Time did come first ... I think the dino in the movie is a bit rounder though .
Okay this manual is officially trippy .
The Japanese logo -LRB- ? -RRB- for E.V.O. : Search for Eden makes me laugh a lot .
That 's what I was thinking .
No angry
Is there a fast forward function for Magic 2013 ? I NEED IT .
Space , middle of the earth , etc. ; -RRB-
gurl your Rez Twitter convo reminded me of something and I want to share it . But not HEREEEE .
I 'm amazed it took two years for a Burger King exclusive song to be unlocked in DDR Extreme .
Actually , it does n't have the `` playing live '' listed under PS if that 's updated though WHO KNOWS .
I guess it should ALSO do the `` playing X '' too if you want it too , but I dunno why it would n't .
They need to update their FAQ then lol . Anyway , on the site it says it sends a `` daily summary '' . So then , just wait for that ?
If you 're playing on PS3 I do n't think it will track those notifications . If you DL the desktop thing though it saves trophies . . ?
I love funly stickers . I do n't ever use them though I just like hoard them lol
Pro skills . What is the accessory set comprised of ?
Well that 's cool . Neat extras available with the Journey Collector 's Edition :
Yeah , youknow , silly minorities ! Why do we ever even get mad ?
This lady is having so much fun with her Eye Toy .
VIDEO GAME LOGIC . Also I guess no one developing games has arms like Chris so they 'll never know lol .
He is so handsome and sweet there : and gt ; . Man , I know they said WHY they changed Chris but it 's ridiculous all the same .
Waaaaaaaaah well I just want to play something shooty and maybe horror themed . I 'm not sure what I want yet playful .
NO KAWAII that 's just so weird . Leave characters alone . Do n't make them kawaii or roid-raging like Chris , lol .
There are some games that require DirectX like 10 and 11 which only work on newer OSes . But those both support Vista I think .
That reminds me I own FEAR 3 now . Do you need to play the rest to get it ? I do n't really like FEAR 1 it 's kinda cumbersome angry
but yeah she was totally pretty and wonderful they had no need to change her .
HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY SCRUFF NOW ? This just gets weirder and weirder ...
It 's definitely the case they tried to make her `` hotter '' by 14 year old boy `` hotness '' standards . Ughghghghghghgghhgghghgh
Ghosts everywhere ! I think you could die if your vessel got destroyed oh no angry . I have n't played it in so long I kinda want to
Since WHEN ? I did n't even know I was such a pimp .
Because she 's not REALLY that important so , hey , we 're gonna give our fictional character plastic surgery
WHO IS MY TWIFEY ? !
It just reminded me of Geist cuz you were a ghost and would take control of things . Except I did n't really like the game . angry
Yeah she does n't really look so hot in her new version . WELL WHATEVER THE HELL GUYS DO WHAT YOU WANT .
is that like Internet Boyfriend\/Girlfriends ? Except based around Twitter specifically ? KIDS THESE DAYS ! ! !
That 's what I was assuming , since she has some sort of power goin ' on . Did you ever play Geist ?
It could be cuz of that , or if they just wanted a more infantile character for you to be `` protective '' of disgust .
Twitter wives ?
I am a very good games journalist who remembers everything .
Oh , yeah , I remember hearing something like that too . Was it like someone she possessed ? A sibling ? disgust I DUNNO
WHOAAA . Yeah she still seems very youthful smile . EITHER WAY I wonder if she is excited to be in a game .
I dunno about other characters : o just the lady and the like cop\/detective in the video thingy who was interviewing her .
Well I do n't know but I just always associate Ellen Page things with been underage . Probably due to me watching Hard Candy .
THAT 'S HOW WOMEN GET WHA cry HEY WANT OKAY . THE ONLY WAY EVER IN HISTORY .
It would be weird if that Beyond game had a shower scene that is `` sexy '' since is n't the main character a teen ? 8 -LRB-
I remember it was kind of neat when Madison goes to the club and tortures the guy , but only after being all `` slutty '' : .
Although I was like 15 or something at the time so Samantha was just like `` wtf '' to me .
Poor goddamn Madison . Her stuff still bugs me lol . AND YES S USA IE . That reminds me of my love\/fear of , um , Samantha .
She 's a new VA person right ? If she fails to do a good job with Lara then I have a feeling she wo n't get more gigs lol
It 's not a `` smooth '' game like Bayonetta or DMC , but a competent brawler all the same . And Nick is my new favorite character
But yeah , the whole rape deal ... IT 'S LIKE HEAVY RAIN ALL OVER AGAIN ! ! !
I 'm surprised they DID N'T instruct the VA to cut it out since everyone complained about that last time too .
I will get it so that I can be critical of it LOL . That 's why I bought Lollipop Chainsaw except that ended up being good : v. .
ANY game I play whether I 'm strong or a wussy char makes me jump into their shoes not to their defense . Ugh : V
Nobody wants to play as a woman but they apparently want to `` protect '' them just fine , like new Tomb Raider . EXCEPT NOT .
I wonder if we 're going to ever get another female lead . B surprised K OF MEMORIES DOES N'T COUNT .
Obviously we should make SH games .
I like it ! Then the cop gal could be Cybil . Poor Cybil , either she gets killed in SH1 or she lives to be full of revenge rage
Silent Hill 3 : James ' Adventure . James is harassed by cultists to birth a god . : o
Silent Hill 3 : James ' Adventure . James is harassed by cultists to birth a god . : o
Yeah , like what exactly was that version of the game where they just put Frank West in it ? I DO N'T UNDERSTAND . EVEN NOW .
I 'll do KIRBY KIRBY KIRBY
Have you done it yet ? I 'll do it if you want lol
Naw , if you mentioned it before then I would have been happy to . I thought you were ; -RRB- .
Nintendo 3DS - Rounder than ever before .
I guess they wo n't mention USA dates in that show ? Guess we 'll see when the USA one airs : o
Thanks for noting the time ! I was looking around for how long it is before I took a crack at it .
Yeah , it was pretty fun except for the boss fights . They were especially tough , although neat .
I would suggest making sure TinyPic is n't on the whitelist because every so often they scramble up URLs so images link to others
Sure , and I 've bought games I love multiple times but I do n't want a \* digital \* game at all ! Unless they are free .
Perhaps you should institute like a list of safe imagehosts to use cuz this keeps happening .
`` backloggery.com contains content from , a site known to distribute malware . ''
Yeah dawg , see good things come to those who wait .
The thatgamecompany bundle listing has been on GameFly for a little while now . I love the news cycle just picking it up today playful .
it reminds me of how I will run around in as little clothing as possible in Dead Rising . It 's FUN .
My favorite Bayonetta fanart
One more tweet . Would you play this RE5 ? I would
It 's about average . When something is like 1000 + mg then you might want to get concerned .
I do n't know if you 've seen this a million times before but this makes me giggle :
What .
Although it could just be a marketing trick rather than anything else ; -RRB- . The color scheme looks more like Wii version .
I do n't know if this means anything but the Okami HD trailer shows comparison between the PS2 and PS3 versions .
But can they just port a Wii port to a PS3 ? If it 's easier to port the PS2 code then maybe they would lol .
do you have a video of the voices being ` hacked ' in ?
I figure if they have all the rights second ured to use those voices then they could it 's just a matter if they WOULD . angry
I do n't think so , otherwise I should have gotten a PR update about it . They 're still `` working on it '' or so they say ...
if only lol
`` sexy '' female reporters should be restricted ! ! ! Wait , does that mean women the author would consider `` sexy '' ? disgust
If you 're not looking for something with a meaty graphics card then you 'll see there 's a pretty big selection in that range smile .
I love the word babushka
Nu uh .
I found a spot for it !
EXC USA E ME
supposed to do with this . lol
I decided to try putting it together when you guys were confused in case I could figure it out and now what am I
Wait , WHAT ? Did they give any reasons ?
If you 're going to be downloading anything from Steam 's servers then try and get that soon . Summer Sale is soon : o
Thanks a lot Jason this is like the 4th standee I own . THERE 'S NO R surprised M.
They 're not that hard
No ? Where are you seeing that disgust
YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY ...
Oh no angry
Play more LC
Putting UMDs into the PSP is scary because I never remember which is the right way to do it .
Not in Disney world she does n't .
surprise -LRB-
Gonna play some Earth Defense Force : In second t Armageddon because I can :
I have no idea what to play now .
I just saw that thing you reblogged on Tumblr . Why does DP have SO MUCH STUFF ? ! I 'm still busting up over -LRB- HELLO KITTY -RRB- .
That 's so dumb , I only did n't rescue one because the camera flipped out on me . Oh well lol .
So what determines you getting the bad ending versus good in LC ? Is it just because I played on easy ?
15G - Horrid Birthday
Awesome ! I 've been hungry to see stuff from it lately .
So does that Venus Patrol site that was successful on Kickstarter last October doing anything yet ?
This is what I hope to see from video games every day . ; -RRB-
Man I wanted to deck that guy eating his lunch . I 'd be bothered too if I did n't know what was going on but my goodness B -LRB- .
Yup , on IndieGoGo the project starter keeps any money earned even if the goal is n't met .
That 's just ... Perfect in it 's wrong-ness ! Reminds me of a Craigslist ad selling a Sony Camecube . Yes , with a C.
Sorry but it 's an actual thing someone said .
`` psp 's use little cd 's and you ca n't emulate those in a computer because those use big cd 's ''
Yeah , months t people discounted Nintendo because of their focus on Nintendo Land + Wii U. Still , what they did show was neat .
Yes , I did ! ! ! smile
The name is super ridiculous . It sounds dull or like shovelware ! But it honestly pushes me toward wanting the system more .
the majority of writing for that piece . on GP smile So I just was able to write my own massive impressions for my blog woo !
I could always link them , which may be a smart thing to do on my blog , lol . But for the NintendoLand , another writer did ...
Pikmin 3 - ZombiU -
You still wo n't see \* those \* impressions cuz they are n't on my blog ! I can toss you the links on Twitter happy
I 've got to fill up my Steam wallet in preparation for the upcoming Summer Sale ...
Thanks for the tweet ! smile I also wrote some ZombiU and Pikmin 3 impressions if you 're interested in hearing more bout Wii U , lol
IT 'S SO HARD .
I would want to try sticking pizza in it .
Chocolate covered fried chicken and pizza ? ! WHAT ?
Why is Suda in love with phones ?
depressed that sounds like something you should report to cuz that 's definitely not BL behavior as far as I know
Their `` auidence '' is more mythical than anything else . The average gamer is 30-something and women are not a minority in it .
It seems more and more men are against sexism in games but still want to cater to their `` audience '' all the same .
Just a lil bit
It had some good games , but next time try going easy on the miniskirts and midriffs .
`` Other women I spoke to at the show ... complained about the pro-male environment ... '' but YOU YOURSELF did n't care ? Your male friends ?
It sure does stink though that many women have had to try and speak these points many times , to be shot down , then accepted by men later .
At least more men are becoming aware of the multitude of issues women face in and around the industry instead of waving it off .
Most often when I read a E3 `` booth babe '' thing by men they shift the focus onto women who game . Never do they really say `` this hurts me too ''
`` In this forgotten version , Leatherface can produce rainbow blocks ... ''
texty text ?
I 'll be sure to share a link once it 's online !
I just wrote way too much about Nintendo Land .
oh my lord
Patches coming before the end of the year ! Yeah , that 's what we meant !
Gimme
`` I guess Street Pass is n't more important than my sanity . ''
I was so scared that this would happen to me , or that they would n't think it was my ID -LRB- because it 's an old pic -RRB- .
Yaaaaaaaay and yes you should !
kay man
What I wonder is if other industries also face the same criticism . Car\/electronics expos also are heavy on booth babes , right ?
but they were at the majority of booths . I had no idea it 'd be like this and I do n't know WHO they are trying to cater to . We 're ADULTS !
This was my first E3 and I was incredibly disturbed by `` booth babes '' . I always though it must be some fable or only a handful at cons ...
I figure for hands on posts where Leah and I both played the game we should both weigh in on the same post , yes ?
Bacon !
I do n't notice an accent from you lol
Want me to do `` hands on '' posts for each of the games I got to play the de months of ? Or just like the bigger things ?
thank youuuuu sir
I guess that explains that months t of them were skinny , stereotypically attractive women playful
JEEZ you act like there are n't zillions of people crowding Ninty 's area ! Also I found out months t of the booth helpers were just hired
Did not expect Nintendo Land to be so good .
tried the pro controller
I support this
lol the rest of the day . You act like there is not a big butt line .
there is a Game Quest booth . Would Marge be there ? Lol
God of War 3 and Uncharted are good exclusives . Killzone or Metal Gear Solid 4 if you can handle controller-based FPS game lol
you got to add me sometime lol
yeah tomorrow too
I do n't want to call lol I am a baby
I love you
I have a question for you . How are we supposed to find her ? Lol
so you 're saying she is here ? No not yet we just have hit smaller areas
as opposed to a smart phone camera lol
leah is taking pics with a real camera
I touched him .
Akira Yamaoka oh my god
Lol Book of Memories
I 'm readyyyyyyyyyyyy
You have control of the twitters today , sirrrr
Gah , that reminds me I still need to buy it !
The trailer raises too many questions . Why can the mushrooms fly ? Why do they hatch from eggs ?
Something about the main mushroom 's blank expression gets to me .
This game cover !
I 'm amazed they only devoted time to showing one Vita title .
Get itttttttt ... ... .
More dubstep .
Water for sure but snaaaacks ... Gotta get snacks ! grin
I actually always thought months t of the gameplay de months are pre-recorded footage .
Hey gurl since you went last year rrlike you can bring cameras of course into E3 but what about food in a backpack ?
I did not just hear that !
We 'll make it through somehow !
Yes please depressed
Why do you do this Ubisoft
lol the cows run
Hi E3 buddy happy
1PM PST for EA , 3PM PST Ubisoft , then Sony at 6PM PST .
More than anything it 's how uncomfortably her voice actor plays the role at times .
To me it 's not the beating up which is necessarily an issue . Look at Snake in MGS3 got way destroyed near the start .
Also , you do n't have to be a woman to cry foul about it ; -RRB- .
Compare and contrast her to Nathan Drake , which I guess is the closest `` survivor hero who gets hurt a lot '' .
Why
It 's too bad considering other REs have done better with playing as a woman .
The car is a woman ? A woman is a car ? What .
You wish !
I 'm using the browser on PS3 .
Yeah , I 'm hopeful for Sony 's conference . Xbox though has shown there 's really little worth showing ... playful
I hate to say I 'm excited by Nike + Kinect Training but I am . I like using tech alongside exercising . It tracks things better than by hand .
Yes but now it is Spanish ! Also there are more content providers I guess . lol cry ALLY WORTH MENTIONING ALL OVER AGAIN
Sports , sports , sports , sports , sports
I do n't even like talking on the phone why would I ever want to talk to my TV ? I STILL do n't get it .
Dubstep is going to destroy me .
That 's the question ! More than anything I 'm really curious how it ever made it onto Steam .
Man , I THOUGHT it must have only been me somehow . But you 're totally right about it being racist .
I wish we could get all the same colors of Japan and Europe . Do other regions really have such different color tastes ? : o
Someone 's gone rogue on GP ! rrwell actually , just did n't see your tweets playful .
Oh god .
Mii Wara Wara what
ZOMBIES ARE AFTER ME !
Stick-type devices !
Why do I always fall under the world in games ?
STOP SAYING IT 'S RUMORED
We 're in sync !
I beat Chibi-Robo ! Woooooo grin
He should say that you ca n't get through unless -LRB- hint -RRB- lol .
Try walking in and out a few times -LRB- without dying -RRB- .
The TV guy should give you a hint about how to get past them .
I love the diary-writing worm smile .
Cuz everyone heard it through GAF and of course GAF is n't a legitimate source . : V
IF YOU KEEP SAYING THAT SORT OF STUFF IT MAY DAMPEN HIS REAL OPINION .
I guess you already paid off LC then ? I assume you grabbed from them since they 're also doing the $ 45 .
You could n't wait for AX ? playful
Good lord .
Okay that 's four news posts I 've seen now rumoring the AC Vita title . It 's real and there 's loads of info out in GI . Take a look , journos !
Interestingly it also has the screenshots\/deets of Dead Space 3 which months t sites already ran . Why did n't peeps see this bit ?
It 's no rumor . Got that issue of GI yesterday . smile
This is iniquitous !
So , is anyone aware of how trans-friendly E3 is ? In regards to registration\/credential check stuff .
Boop I has questions for you whenever you are around : o
Weeee ! smile
Ummmmmm Jason I need you whenever you 're available .
Cuz everyone was focused on Dead Space .
Cuz everyone was focused on Dead Space .
So , is there a reason no one is talking about Assassin 's Creed : Liberation ?
The soundtrack is fantastic smile . And art . And everything , lol .
Chibi-Robo just put a pirate ship INTO HIS HEAD !
Lol I need to be more careful of what account I 'm tweeting from .
Ow angry
I drew my version of Chibi-Robo
You need a funk transplant .
