likewise . I sometimes struggle to drag myself places , always worth it though . First round is on me ; - -RRB-
wassup sir ? I 'll look forward to seeing you smile
ill drop u a Facebook email with what I did . Unfortunately I do n't have a hotline for him . Connection patchy at moment
no worries . Appreciate your interest in out kaggle comp and your kind words
these were my thoughts earlier this week
good to see you the other day Paul . The 3 of us should plan something , or maybe you and Udo can get training to attend ?
it 's not all done yet mate . Agonising over remaining slots
appreciate yours and others inputs into limitations . However , this is meeting our goals of exploring performance over guessing
looking forward to seeing the results , and looking through all entries , incase one finds extremes better but has lower AP
sorry Frank . Big hugs to you buddy
btw . Love the name , traveling salesman . AI was simple then eh ; - -RRB-
we 'll be presenting the results at if you happen to be there .
Basingstoke Town FC ?
Follow Friday for the Starsky and amp ; Hutch -LRB- Cagney and amp ; Lacey ? -RRB- of Scottish Hacking . Recently minted speakers and amp ;
I look forward to seeing you on home turf . Congrats
you can change the email address with additional verification them -LRB- i imagine -RRB-
when I last looked -LRB- in fairness -RRB- , it did just seem like session cookies rather than tracking .
cheers Ryan . You going ? I was totally amped to get selected in the first round . Especially seeing the other talks
think I accidentaly unfollowed you or something , if you 'd like to follow back again . No drama if you do n't though . smile
yeah , being on tv is not easy and newsnight is probably least easy of them all . Millican done well IMO
should have got bozier on ref this - and gt ; -LRB- second urity problem ? What problem -RRB- smile
take a look at this blog post
have you been aware of the second urity problems and misleading statements ?
seen wedding crashers ? smile
wonder if its cos shit was newer then . There was more to learn . Now just variations on a theme
One for smile
and then do n't continue mislead users about it - see my post -LRB- I warned them on Friday too -RRB- - sigh
One cool thing about is that it 's exposing some decent app second talent If you 're ever out of work , ping me
I tried to warn them and so did others . Do n't suppose you 're looking for an app second job are you -LRB- we 're hiring -RRB-
that 's a lot of points . Did you have to pay people ... no wait ... do n't tell me .
maybe the RBS spokesborg needs a reboot too ?
ha . Exactly my point here they 're ok regarding cookie regulation though
you got Justin Biebers latest yet ? smile sorry ... could help it
yeah , do n't get me wrong , it 's still a nightmare . My concerns are outlined here
maybe Jay 's a douchebag smile
does n't appear to need a cookie script though as it 's cookies are covered under the exemptions
please do blog the threads . Read an interesting paper about statistical significance being over egged too
they certainly do n't have tracking cookies and amp ; finding good guidance in nigh on impossible
is it clear that cookie notices are required for basic operation though ? Does n't look clear
I wrote this last year on that topic not brilliant , but maybe up your strasse
now , second urity aside , i think they 're onto a good idea in there somewhere . Not the current offering , but from that
assuming it means she does n't hold much hope for the future of menshn
so misleading users by stating it 's not only second ure , but second urity claims are unfounded is iffy to say the least really .
that 's fair enough smile Given the evidence by multiple second urity experts , it 's safe to say it was not second ure though .
it is turning into a hate-fest for many , and that 's wrong too .
I do feel bad for them , but just stating users are safe when they ca n't possibly state that seems like it 's just wrong .
we exchanged emails . I urged him to heed the issues , then sure enough , on Sunday others pounced on the vulnerabilities
agreed . Wrote as much here Denying there was a problem has put some users password at risk
that was my criticism , blogged on here They misled users while they knew of issues
even with a couple of experts , they really need to take the code apart and largely start again . Bloody minefield really .
I do n't wish it on them . But saying the site is second ure is just misleading . Agree it must be harsh on them though . Not nice
it would have been tough , but they 'd have been up again for a better stab at it . This will get worse IMO .
that 's true for sure . Ca n't help feeling they 'd have got great respect if they 'd listened to the hoard of second urity experts
I called him on that too , here
admit that it 's harsh , but they knew of this on Friday and should perhaps have done the right thing as public figures .
this is why to some degree ... Trust and honesty . The site is putting users passwords at risk
doing bedtime with the little lad . Should have another out before newsnight .
LOL - England losing on penalties is a passage of rites for the new players\/fans smile
always am . Always on penalties . always . frown
or a decade too late
nope logins were over http until late last night
not day one exactly was it ? it 's the constant misleading that 's worrying
this has been interesting over the weekend and second urity and amp ;
I 've 'd second urity and misleading users a number of times since Friday night - and gt ;
LOL ! smile I made my point . Was aware that I was getting a bit flustered about being misled though .
I think they have a greater obligation for transparency than months t.
nice to see a respected publication call this out . it 's too important to sweep under the carpet
done
appreciate the retweet . Was concerned about striking the right balance to not be troll like or inflammatory
but where did you get insight to the ico or the second urity notice being published ? Curious
this is what troubles me the months t about It 's the misleading of the public when the evidence is clear
this is my issue with yesterdays messhn - enjoyed seeing you become so highly rated
this post explains what troubles me months t about their handling of second urity
thanks for the quick eyeball . I wanted to ensure it was at least balanced . It 's a high profile record for sure
turns out I still had to write up my issues . Curious for your feedback
This is what troubles me months t about `` Don t misleading users about your second urity ''
but I love you piece of trusting politicians
I 'm not sure about the cookie law though , seems the cookie is n't used for tracking , it 's for basic functionality
brilliant post ! ! ! Saves me a job this morning smile
the worst thing is seeing how well politicians can lie . Sickening . frown
fantastic to hear . smile with these things its best to be honest incase hacktivist groups do it for you
the blatant denial of second urity issues is still deeply worrying . Password issue was raised on Friday
ps . Any chance you can fix the password reminder page so it emails you back ? it to smile
it probably still is n't `` guff '' . Please listen to the rationed mind of and seek pro second urity help
https . Good news all around . Then second ure the session id and spend some money on app second cc
but a safe 1 It must be a depressing job putting together the `` England are out '' montage for the as the tournament progs . . ''
could n't agree more . Nor is it to discredit the idea , which I sort of like -LRB- at least curious about -RRB- .
brilliant smile
tweet clash smile - your tweet plus my tweet = poetry = OPPOSITE of Eng frown
next time , I really am betting
` kin bollox . Typical frown
that is true . Everyone screws up .
their site is hosted in the USA so doubly interesting . Sorry heart nearly stopped with that non goal . Phew
where do people stand if they click a short-link with embedded XSS ? I suspect it could be enough of a pain
he 's right . Please ask an independent second urity pro for an opinion . Peoples passwords are too important to treat like this
like just watching from sidelines unable to help . I suspected XSS and the rest but did n't dare test . Others r more `` brave ''
I feel bad . I emailed em Friday about the passwords in clear text . Now it 's like seeing death by second urity unfold live
I 'm not even clicking shortlinks related to it . Did report clear text passwords to them though . Painful to watch all the same
yeah , I would n't go anywhere near that personally . Just watching people 's screen caps .
and this too -LRB- this made me lol -RRB-
oh and this
I emailed them 3 times , first time was Friday night regarding passwords over http -LRB- an easy fix -RRB-
heres someone 's xss I snapped earlier
or read this
log on with fiddler and see your password I 've http
England are looking vulnerable ... A bit like - Great blog post on some of the issues
I got 1000 coming my way if they bring on in the 75th minute
yeah , I had 5 on that
I 'd love to share that . Safe to say , I think they ignored my 2nd email offering my phone number to talk about the seriousness
I got 50 on Italy , via an overhead kick in the 62nd minute . Bollox
I really did try to articulate this too them . I 'm sure they 'd gain more respect turning it off until it 's fixed .
innocent code is pretty good too .
this might help trust me ... worth a read
careful . Everytime I say `` mention '' I visualise it as ... In less than 48hrs . I need help
that 's where I tweet ; - -RRB-
yeah illegal is a safe bet
. I sort of like the concept behind , love the name and the font \/ logo . Security looks awful from the client side
. a number of people tried to warn them , but they responded with this You decide who 's right
This thing is turning into something akin to a fun-talk live demo at
if you 'll be at defcon this summer , it 's a story I 'd like to hear over a beer . I saw clear text passwords and ran . . then watched
does that say `` vars of piss '' ? Oh noes
one day I 'd love to hear the story about how you did that . Brave\/amusing
are you two in the pub ?
erm ... or any computer between yours and menshn . I like the concept guys , but seriously , it looks very in second ure indeed
Wow ! ! ! claiming -LRB- -RRB- is `` is a safe , clean and amp ; second ure environment . '' and lt ; - it months t certainly is not .
it 's not safe . That much is certain
I emailed them about the seriousness of these second urity issues . Like watching someone walk into oncoming traffic
Oh dear , I knew it would n't be long before I saw goatse angry '' and lt ; -- I worried about that too . Puts me off my dinner
you could try emailing the luke at - it really \* is \* a risk guys

ok ... that 's the winner right there ! ! smile
buy buy buy smile
perfect ! ! ! That 's exactly the sort of message , because folks are happy to role the dice in coffee shops
Follow on from earlier question , any pointers to known Trojans etc that grab usernames and passwords ? -LRB- ps . Thanks to everyone who replied -RRB-
that is exactly the issue . Very much a `` yeah , but hackers are n't interested in me '' , they do n't consider bots\/Trojans
nice

Maybe it really is time to review all these loopholes though as that 'd be fair . Wonder what will say ...
Just predicting one of the discussions on Certainly not suggesting I would n't do what months t contractors do either . Mini rant over
People pissed off with should probably be pissed off with months t contractors too . Government should close loophole or zip it IMO .
I 'm not that bothered either as it goes ; - -RRB-
that would be cool . One day maybe smile
ahhh . it was spam from a specific company where he 'd already requested to not be emailed . Otherwise , yeah , tricky

My fav quote from `` Snakes in Suits '' ... `` In the great card game of life , psychopaths know what cards you hold , and they cheat . ''
