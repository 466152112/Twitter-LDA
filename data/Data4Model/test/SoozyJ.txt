wooooo ! Can you FB message me your shifts ? I want to see if we 'll be there at the same time .
yay ! ! ! Which day ?
Just did Body Combat 52 for the 1st time . Loved tracks 4,5 and 8 , not sure about the rest . Hoping they 'll grow on me .
Awww shame angry I know what you mean about running out of time though .
Are you going to an opening ceremony rehearsal ?
I just do n't get it . Just because he was involved with the bid and half the world seems to love him is n't a reason to be picked .
Yay ! Have fun ! I 'm there in a couple of weeks for mine .
I really need to go to bed , but the tennis just keeps on going ...
Just painted my fingernails red , white and blue .
I do n't know . The BBC do n't have many details yet . Where are you staying ? It looks lovely .
BBC says 16:25 . You must have just missed it . Gald you 're ok xx
BBC News are saying there was a big fight at Westfield and people were stabbed . 1 guy dead angry Are you still at the Cow ?
Are you ok Claire ?
this is probably why angry
I agree smile happy Friday to you too !
I got the same a couple of days ago . There are some crazy people out there .
wow ! ! ! I 've always loved the basketball arena , now I love it even more .
yay ! UDAC ? Looks like your travel should be ok , so long as you can get out of Newcastle .
It 's a bit disconcerting having a combat instructor watching you half the class so he can follow your timing when choreography changes .
Good news smile I 've just been looking at photos - scary stuff , especially when the weather 's gorgeous down here .
are you home yet Claire ? I 'm worrying about you a little . xx
where are you sitting ? I 'm block 106 .
In exactly 4 weeks time I will be in the Olympic Stadium watching the dress rehearsal for the Olympic Opening Ceremony . Sooooo excited !

read it on Ellie 's page . The guy who said it is volunteering at UDAC so would know .
apparently he 's paid Locog staff and not a volunteer . Makes it even worse .
Hi ! Good job I do n't care about the football smile
It 's going to be a wet in Luton today angry Looking forward to volunteering anyway though .
Finding it odd that I seem to be listening to Radio 1 more than xfm recently . I used to think I was too old for Radio 1 , but it seems not .
On an absolutely massive post-Body Combat , pre-Olympic high right now grin
I do n't think I 'll make it Claire . It 's my last free weekend before the Olympics so I need to prepare angry
Same here Liz . Looking forward to seeing you later smile
Games Maker shift upset over . Apparently I 'm now in an `` elite mobile team '' but can leave early if too tired from the longer\/later shifts .
I was dreaming about the Olympic opening ceremony when I was woken by torrential rain at 5am . I hope that is n't an omen for the 27th of July
Stonehenge
Could n't work out why my arms hurt today . Then I remembered the tricep press ups at Combat last night . Ouch !
Wow , thanks James ! I 've finally got a ticket to track cycling after months of trying unsuccessfully .
I wonder if there 'll be a competition for tickets to the Paralympic Opening Ceremony rehearsals as well ?
Probably . And close to London for them to get to . I miss the days of petrol price reports from the Dome Roundabout though .
I would n't be surprised . One guy at my RST was getting all the easy questions wrong when we did exercises
I think Opening Ceremony performers get some tickets for family and friends too .
Front row ticket to the Paralympic swimming ! ! ! Soooooo excited
I 'd love to know how many tickets they have to give away to us .
Talking about inflation going down , and partly because of lower petrol prices . Not sure why they chose Watford .
noooooo angry
The 6 o'clock news is in Watford and they interviewed one of the taxi drivers who took me to Heathrow recently !
I need one of those too ! How do I set one up on my phone ?
Being hungry all the time is getting boring angry
I read that as ` tart box ' ! ! How long will they be around for ?
Well done everyone who took part in the Watford today ! I had a great time volunteering and looking forward to Luton next week .
No ! I 'm just about to head to mine . Glad I 'm not the only one ready for it .
It 's just perfect is n't it ? I 'll have to see if I can watch her play since I 'll be at ExCeL .
hahaha I love it !
have a great day Keith !
grin yay indeed ! Hope you 're well . Any trips over here in the pipeline ?
thanks Mel smile xx
thanks Melissa ! How do I make pretty hearts like that ?
Thanks Marsha smile I hope Canada 's treating you well . You 're still missed over here . xx
thanks Matt ! Seems like forever ago and only yesterday all at once . Lots of love to you all . anger
7 years cancer free today ! Happy to be alive and looking forward to an amazing summer smile
hahaha I know that feeling ! Even better when you have a whole row to yourself ! Unless some latecomer comes and ruins it !
I finally have my Olympic tickets . Yay ! ! !
Balance ? ? That just sounds wrong .
hehehe sounds like a great look !
I really do n't think I can cope with so many late shifts . Was a nice balance before . Will have to email and see if they 'll change
they 've changed every shift so now all end between midnight and 1am and none are in the sport arenas , all in the foyer bit .
There seems to be some massive Body Combat thing in Bristol this weekend . I am in Bristol this weekend . But I 'm hanging out with my grandma !
yeah , pretty much . I wonder how many people they 're losing because of these shift patterns . Must be quite a few .
I asked for a couple of shifts to be moved , but they 've changed every single one to really late times and rubbish part of building
Games maker shifts all changed and all to rubbish ones . Would rather not even do them and just buy spectator tickets instead angry
I know angry I might have 2 work trips to fit in in July and really do n't want to miss VST angry Have emailed , but no answer yet .
I 'm a very excited Games Maker ! 50 days tomorrow until my first shift !
I 'm still waiting for my first VST email angry
Great news ! Thanks very much for the quick reply .
Me too !
Will there be opportunities for people outside Luton to get tickets for the torch concert ? Is so ho with when ? Thanks .
There 's no such thing as too pink playful It 's a great jacket !
B -RRB- 2
Ellie and the made a list before Orientation training . If you ask on fb someone may be able to find it .
I still ca n't believe he stayed in and Jaz went out .
I stopped watching a few weeks back . Sounds like I made the right decision .
