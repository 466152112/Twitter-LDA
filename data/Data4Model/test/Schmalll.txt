Listening to Colin Firth explain how he and Tom Ford worked through ' A Single Man ' is just ... beyond amazing .
I 'm a manque .
Wow James Lipton only has to say ` Mr Darcy ' in a Colin Firth interview and the crowd goes wild .
People in other parts of the world have read amazing stuff like The Odyssey , and when I look at myself I 'm just like ... - facepalm -
