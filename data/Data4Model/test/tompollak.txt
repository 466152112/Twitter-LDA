Really want to see Planet of Snail but ca n't see it being shown anywhere in London ...
Farewell to the Minitel : I remember these from my French exchange when I was 12 ! They were great .
Missed the Turks oil wrestling at the Anatolian Cultural Fete . Gutted . BUT Rokia tonight , then Rihanna\/Azealia Banks etc tmrw . All Hackney .
sounds good . I like roofs . x
for sure . Always have a pack of stickers . Actually as of August might come to GOSH on occasion , I 'll say hi ...
Not all bath salts are alike :
And contrary to Lansley 's threats , EVERY nurse I spoke to supportive , as we were to them last yr . A shame there was n't a united action .
Also , wo n't change to career average pension dissuade docs from pursuing research\/PhDs etc ? Further hobbling UK scientific innovation ?
For those who think docs ' pensions and destruction\/privatisation of the NHS are diff issues :
-LRB- although all this talk of docs on 120K is insane : months t that I know earn around a quarter of that -RRB-
Thanks regardless of whether you think doctors get paid too much , WE HAD A DEAL .
So my day spent ` striking ' has been just as busy as a normal work day . Except I got to have a lunch break .
Wow , amazing to think that people think this is about doctors wanting more money .
