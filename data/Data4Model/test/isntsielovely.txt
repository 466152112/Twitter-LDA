I want to be an athletic PT because it seems fun , and there is money in it not because I 'm an avid sports fan .
I guess I should start paying more attention to sports because of my major . I 'm not gonna pretend to have a deep passion for it though .

That 's only because I 'd rather work with basketball athletes more then any other .
Even though I 'm an athletic training major I do n't watch sports . But if I had to choose , I 'd rather sit through a bball game over football .
