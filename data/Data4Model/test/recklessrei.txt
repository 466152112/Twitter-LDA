... no toilets available during the 4 hour wait , staff were friendly but unprepared . Not acceptable .
Al months t missed our plane after being stranded at Knebworth in the rain for 4 hrs , our 11 happy 0pm coach did n't leave until 3:45 am
Also , the font used on the Swedish jersey has too many serifs . It should look like Ikea .
Is it just me , or are Ibrahimovic and Carroll identical twins ?
