K : I was never going to get a small dog then , but then I saw -- hey where 'd he go ?
My dog only eats the lamb bits in your Lamb and amp ; Rice food , how about a lamb only bag ?
just bought a pair of jeans . It 's Jeans Summer at work . This counts as a work expense .
visited my fiance at his work . nothing like seeing a man work .
Chewie had a seizure last night . He seems back to normal , we think it was because he had n't eaten in a while .
getting a mini cooper . Woo .
I still do n't understand my medical bill . But when I get the refund , I would have paid less than $ 40 for my Mirena IUD .
