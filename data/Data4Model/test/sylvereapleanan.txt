I need a treadmill so I can walk at home in just my socks .
Either the shoes do n't have enough arch support or they put pressure on the top of my feet and amp ; cut off circulation . My current pair do both .
I 've decided I hate walking as exercise , in part between c my sneakers do n't fit . It 's all but impossible to find a fit for my extra high arches .

Welcome ! FYI , if you get a Corgi , brush first , then bathe . Your drain will thank you . You can brush again after if you like .
Just make sure you do the brushing OUTSIDE . The birds\/squirrels will and lt ; 3 you . Also consider getting a Dyson Pet .
A vacuum if they 'll hold still for it . Otherwise , we use a regular bristle brush . I 've heard pos . reviews of Furminator too .
We had a collie when I was a kid and amp ; Mom had a Samoyed\/Great Pyrenees mix . I have \* never \* seen a dog shed like our Corgi , LOL .
Corgis do shed though . TONS . Do n't get one unless you 're ok with dog hair everywhere . They also bark a lot so not ideal 4 apts .
Our Corgi does n't have skin proble Ms No back\/joint issues either but he 's only 4 . Might not have hip dysplasia until older .
Applied for job @ Goodwill today . Need xtra $ $ for homeschooling projects . Plus , it satisfies my volunteerism streak . X fingers for me ! ! !
