Awesome , I 'll look for those ones .
I have n't ! My library seems to have boatloads of stuff by her so I should be able to try them out !
Can somebody please look at this and tell me what I should read next based on my interests ?
Wesley had a 2hr diaperless nap today . I 'm okay with the angry naptime clothes-stripping as long as he does n't pee the bed !
Someone I know needs to host a Sword of Truth \/ Legend of the Seeker party so I have an excuse to sew Kahlan 's Confessor dress .
Wesley is having the time of his life eating a big pile of za'atar off the kitchen table .
Re : my overdue book : I went ahead and read it last night and returned it this morning . Sorry for abusing the system , library patrons .
Nope . We have ours strictly for our Xbox with Netflix , Hulu , etc. . No TV channels for us .
Wesley has been going to daycare for two months , and just this morning I discovered I did n't have their phone number in my phone . Whoops .
Hahaha , this is essentially what I was thinking . I could probably finish it today if I get started now .
Should I return it now , or power through it tonight so I can return it in the morning having read it ?
AGGGH Remembered I got an email a week ago saying my library book was due in 2 days . Ca n't renew now between c there are holds . I AM THAT JERK .
Turns out that even if I have my phone on vibrate , a texted video will autoplay , AT FULL VOLUME , if opened . Sorry , quiet office . My mistake .
This has made my day . Oh my goodness .
Also , Wesley says `` MOM '' like he is about to say , `` MEATLOAF ! '' afterward . Like this : Dislike .
We 've now reached the `` L surprised K MOM ! WATCH THIS , MOM ! '' phase . Hold me .
I. . . may not have taken any . DUMB , I KNOW . But I think someone else did , I 'll see if I can get some !
Thanks ! -LRB- Forgot to add that Wesley was Dobby and it was excellent ! -RRB-
It was amazing . I also made a `` brick wall '' out of a sheet so partygoers could run through Platform 9Â 3\/4 to get inside .
Yesterday I had a Harry Potter-themed b-day party , and my mom came as Molly Weasley , my dad as Neville L , and my brother as Sirus Black .
Wesley saw me watching this and thought it was great . `` More watch baby fall WHOMP ! '' Many replays .
Thank you ! -LRB- AH ! I am so happy for you ! -RRB-
! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I WAS GOING TO ASK RIGHT AFTER GRADUATION BUT DID N'T WAN cry O INTRUDE . OMG . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Congrats , you two ! You are both lovely .
Thank youuuu !
Never heard of that being a problem . We 've done several 7 + hr trips and he has n't made a peep about it , FWIW .
Yes , Wesley is over 2 and is still rear-facing . They can bend knees or cross legs . RF until at least two is safer so why not ?
Daniel got a wrong-number text from `` Derik '' so he texted back `` what is a derik '' and I am laughing so hard but also dying from embarrassment .
YES ! You are ! AH !
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU ! ! !
Me too . Have it as an option , sure , but do n't pre-check it for me ! Ridic .
Plus , my kid is two . I have that saved in my prefs . He would n't even need it ! Why pre-check it ?
Thanks but no thanks for pre-checking formula as one of my interests in my acct preferences . It months t decidedly is not .
You are amazing !
I wrote a post about this recently - I just do n't understand what people see in Angel . May have to rewatch first few seasons .
I need to confess : I had a dream last night that Spike and I were fending off a zombie horde from my parents ' house .
SWEET NECTAR OF LIFE
Ah - tapioca is divisive . I love it . Do you also dislike bubble tea ?
Sacrilege .
I know why I 'm supposed to be laughing , but `` hafflepuffhouse '' is getting me too . HAFFLEPUFF .
Diaperless nap update : He slept for THREE HOURS without peeing the bed . I had to pat down his sheets three times before I believed it .
W was being naughty this morning so I put him in his crib for some quiet time . He fell asleep , which would b great if he were n't diaperless .
`` Hey Wecky , want to take a shower ? '' `` No. . Want to watch TV . '' WHAT ? ! He does n't even watch TV ! Where do they learn these things ?
