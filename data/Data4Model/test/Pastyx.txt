Wind street my long lost friend , I 'm coming for you .
Really guys ? I feel special
It 's okay , I 'll pretend I did n't see
the boys are going up for a pint anyway I think . there was about 15 of us , no spewing haha ! Few of us nearly did though haha
Dunes , sprints and circuits . Hurting haha ! You up the club today mate ?
Britton and Xavi are alike only in the number of passes they make . Creativity there are miles apart
Have you seen comparing Xavi and Britton ! ?
What the fuck is Platini on about again this morning
Conditioning over for the day , proper fucked but glad it 's over .
Okay brother .
Michael Hughes is taking me and You driving ?
Beach training at 10am . This ai n't going to be pretty .
What a clown . Where 's he been , Bridge ?
What a nutter he is honest to god
That makes absolutely no sense
1\/2 a pint later . .
Hold my hands up , totally wrong .
haha , I 'm clucking son ! Doing tomorrow mate ?
Haha , well I think it 's that ? I do n't claim to be a chicken expert ?
Unfertilised eggs = eggs . Fertilised eggs = Chicks ?
Mama told me not to come - Tom Jones . This song just randomly popped into my head !
I get an email from the Uni saying there 's work everyone has to pick up , I send my old down and there 's no work there ? WTF .
Why am I up \*\*\*\* , I 'm gonna start teaching you how to spell good boy !
I 'm shocked Germany went out last night . My old man backed Italy at the start of the tournament , 16\/1 ! Fucker .
Yeah , just when you get to do that thing when you move your legs back and fore quite fast , oh yeah running !
I have n't either , lmao ! Enjoy last night brother ?
I 've never had that bad luck . Haha , wood
` and as it always has , paper covers rock ' hahaha . Such a good program !
Oo that 's got to hurt .
Do youknow the rules ? It 's so confusing haha !
I 'm glad I 'm off it for a bit , lost 1 stone 13 lbs like !
I have n't drunk since I 've been on it , I 'm impressed
About 100 mate for a month
Slamming as it goes !
I did n't cheat the first 2 weeks , this week I 've been terrible though haha !
quite a bit mate ! Sorry mate did n't see this !
Haha , you 're full of these fair play
Because uber facts is full of believable facts . That 's just one theory
Hitting your funny bone , is not fucking funny .
17 stone 3 lbs !
I 'm bored of you now
Exactly my argument , Messi has no physical attributes to be a footballer but tears FBs a new asshole .
If I called a player purely on stats then that would be contradiction . e.g. Britton as good as Xavi on stats
1 stone 13 lbs actually haha !
Yeah because I said that ? I said judging a player on purely stats is idiotic , which I stand by .
I 'm still a unit but a tad slimmer !
You claim to be the new football genius , and you ca n't spell the name of one of the best ever ?
Spell his name right before you go quoting him please !
Haha , I bit , but I 'm midway through a Ronaldo\/Messi argument haha !
You 've been watching football properly for 2-3 years , bar watching Man United ? Come on now Ad , stick to Music ?
Messi you 're right , but Gerrard ? Dreaming !
I did show him this mate . .
It 's not judging him purely on stats , because I 've seem him play what 50 + times ?
Irrelevant ? months t of the records are for this season .
Landed with the weight i 've lost ! is hard but worth it , 1 more week to go !
he was in no shadow Mac , he was 17 and Ronaldinho was the world 's best at the time . Whenever he played he was boss .
You did , but it is n't just one stat it 's about 12 or 13 , whoever says Messi is n't the greatest player on the planet is not well
The fact is Ad that Messi is regarded by months t as the greatest ever . CR7 is outstanding , but Messi is a one-off .
Hahaha knew this was coming
Not over yet son !
Haha , we 'll see now
Ronaldo 's bound to miss a penalty .
Hahaha I 'm in pieces
How does Custodio have so much more hair than you ?
It 's shit .
Germany 2 - 1 Italy , Spain 3 - 1 Portugal .
The Burger Kings of Leon .
Just went and bought Warrior on Blu-ray , just to watch it again . What a film !
It is absolutely shocking . Not even funny .
Am I the only one that absolutely hates Ice Age ?
Kim and Lenny did , you coming Thursday ?
It 's not there now
Time to grow up !
I have no idea where it is , and Curtis wants it back anyway
I knew I would
Good mate , conditioning was hard but the training was so much better .
I do n't want money you nutter , I 'll bring my laptop over tomorrow or something
I stand corrected !
That sentence makes no sense ! Haha , but yeah it 's good !
Yeah I heard it aswell , Generation 303 . Ledge !
Do n't think he could cut it .
Butterface I believe the technical term is . .
S ` alright brother !
I tried , and they 're dreadful haha .
If you ca n't chalky , you 're not allowed out
Gonna be hurting tomorrow but alright rrlike you butt ?
That 's where the Americans go on spring break ! Because their drinking in USA is 21 .
Shape 10\/10 , maybe not the face ! I deleted it when I realized
' i should have a degree in pulling women ' the man is a legend .
Anna from is definitely a slag on the side .
Not at all , worst thing on tele that and
I heard actually fancies a night with the Bonymaen boys ?
Big Brother is shit !
Gaz fingers at least 20 birds in this episode ,
Haha mate I do n't doubt you for a second ond
Working were you butt ?
It was harder than it sounds , trust me !
Pretty hard but I think it 's gonna get harder . 25 mins conditioning , tackling , and a little game at the end .
Barry Fry !
Training session over and done with , glad the first one 's out of the way .
Just been informed Liverpool made a new bid of 17 million for Adam Johnson earlier today .
Am I looking forward ? Yeah , I love fitness I do .
Fanks babe .
I 'm debating having 1 shake and having a meal for lunch tomorrow haha
I thought as much .
Haha , you do make me laugh
I do n't need ` statement ' shirts to become a top puller .
I do n't think it was honest !
No , I will be telling them how shocking their shirt is , i 'm mortified .
You said about the socialising part , are you one of those ` we do n't speak , we suffer and sweat now ' type characters ?
2 of the colors are Neopolitan though are n't they ? Still , it 's a terrible shirt .
Haha , what an attitude . Leave it all in the gym do you ?
How similar is Dutch to English ! Jesus
Am I right in thinking that 's the colors of a neopolitan ice cream ? Absolutely ransid .
Could probably fit about 4 of you in one of them , that type of thing ?
Haha , without even looking i 'm gonna hazard a guess and say that 's very similar to Jacamo . Am I right ?
It 's been used once Jonty . Come on from a teacher i 'd expect a quicker mind than that . Poor from you .
There 's always one funny bloke ! Today Mr. Hanley , that 's you
Anyone recommend any sites for clothes ?
You 'd swear some people are being paid tweet by tweet . Non stop
Haha , why thankyou !
Your breasts are just fantastic .
It 's absolutely nuts pre season starts tomorrow . Looking forward to it , but not how much it 's gonna hurt .
I have 0 motivation this morning .
Yeah haha , 4.30 !
Aww mate ! Such a romantic .

All companies have agreed not to give you a job . Sorry to say
That 's why I tweeted you it haha . Amazing
You 're \*
You 're \*
zzzzzz Should n't you be playing with your guitar or something .
It 's not out of the question , but I think they 'll be too strong for the Azzuri .
They 're designed for fast contractions , so yeah short bursts with low levels of oxygen .
Gotta admit , kinda funny one of the late Italy subs was a man !
As classy as Pirlo is , he was allowed to play today by England . Germany wo n't make the same mistake .
They 're different colors and sizes and things too . Think the slow twitch are smaller because marathon runners are skinny !
Unlucky Ashley Cole , and it could n't have happened to a nicer guy aswell .
Pirlo - 33 and would walk in any team in England Fact ! Taught England a lesson
If you do n't know Slow twitch are found more in long distance runners , fast twitch in sprinters .
Euro 96 versus Spain ! Just seen it
Would n't know mate ! A while back though
Coolio - Gangsta 's Paradise
I was getting ready haha ! yeah where are you now ?
Thought as much . Grub later ?
Do n't suppose you 'd be up for a game of football ?
Sunday game of football , sounds outstanding .
Is that all you do is moan ? Geeeeeees
HB Lionel m8 .
Hahaha love it
Anyone fancy making themselves a quick 10 ?
Proble Ms
What you doing Chelsssss ?
Raging queer !
Love going to one of the boys ' house , with the keys 15 miles away . .
Miss the classic house parties .
Any reason you favourite\/RT so many Al Jazeera tweets ?
France never lost a competitive game to Spain , think that may change tonight but ca n't see past Germany for the tournament .
Sometimes you ca n't help it when your winger does n't defend with you
He 's played well so far though , it 's either him or Reveilleire in the midfield because they 're both playing . .
meant to be DeBuchy in midfield ai n't it ?
DeBuchy in midfield for France , to man mark Iniesta ! ?
Murray to win more than 3.5 sets 6-0 ?
What about lovely Abertawe ?
Eva Simons is my favorite !
Massive ! They 're ridiculous .
NZ make space where they just should n't .
Hosea Gear , absolute tank !
Jackass is an absolute classic . Love it
well that 's shit
Did agree with myself or
Like printing money ? Hopefully . .
He 's starting !
This maneater is someone you want to avoid , but you can follow from a safe distance .
Haha !
I put Gomez in my dream team because he 's banging them in , and Germany are apparently gonna rest him ? Fuck .
It ca n't be both of you can it . .
My beloved followers , I would like to two people today . and But can I ask , who 's better looking ?
35 Days
Happy birthday sonnnnnnnn x
How many of you ?
Imagine if we did haha , where you from ?
I have no idea where that is ! Kamalaki ? Aphrodite hotel I think . .
What hotel you staying in ?
Bailiffs be around soon for you
Some of us work ok !
it 's Windsor I believe
Watching videos of Laudrup on YouTube , wow what a talent .
Some people have followed and unfollowed me so many times , they 're like an indecisive stalker .
The Nicky Romero version ? Have a listen JR !
What is it with Howley not playing AWJ and Charteris together ?
19th - 26th July , you going ?
I can not wait !
I really want to watch the Dark Knight tonight , but ca n't find my blu-ray . Gutted !
haha love that ! ` alright . . ' as if you genuinely would
Haa , come back the same time as us !
You 've had your turn ! Now it 's ours
starting to get excited now , gonna be off the hook .
That 's what I mean at their level haha ! Obviously not at this level !
For the record I was still up for it so do n't blame me , none of the boys have though
Jason Price was quality too when we are at lower level . Gomez and Anderson too !
And a fit Bodde ?
Haha , you 're not wrong !
I 'm working unlike you , you cretin ! I 'll ring one of you when i finish
Just had a verified fella follow me , I 'm not aware of his work
Bad news for Ukraine with Shevchenko retiring . . but on the plus side Voronin is retiring too , so it 's not all bad !
We all do !
you can come to our meetings now , second ret ones
You get used to it
A sharp Rooney that game could have been 2-0 by HT . Parker does n't look 100 % either , he must be so drained .
3 tough teams to get past . It England beat them 3 teams they 'll deserve to win it no question
You 're repeating my thoughts from earlier haha , that 's what I mean by Chelsea like . Italy will find it hard to break them down !
Break him in !
that 's what she said
I said I do n't know yet so do n't act the big boy on your first day of twitter now !
Senior boys now mun !
Heard you 're booking on Nubs any truth ?
Milner a CM agree with that . England are very ` Chelsea-like ' , tentative , organised and are just picking their moments .
I suppose my words were incorrect but surely watching a player is better than seeing a stat on the player ?
Young has played terrible for England mainly though , as has Milner .
We clearly disagree . I do n't like him never have and never will
Not just that though , where the passes are going -LRB- i.e forward\/sideways -RRB- , areas of the pitch they 're being made in . Goes on . .
I didnt like him at Villa and that 's honest . that was a good midfield though . SD , Milner , Barry and Young . For Villa like
I do n't like him not gonna change my opinion on it
Playing against nobody teams months tly , bar France tonight of course . Overrated and over confident .
But not on one or two stats . Like for example the Britton pass % rate , amazing but he 's nowhere near Xavi 's standard .
Yeah but even watching him play is terrible too , his stats back that up . He offers nothing special and cutting edge
I use stats for\/against a player , but never judge them purely on it , ever . It 's not fair too
I am in shock .
What haha ! ? ! ?
Whoever judges footballers purely on statistics is an idiot .
Mutliple ? He scored once ? Or did he score in the first game ?
Okay , but have you had one ? Deadly serious haha
Any reply ?
Russia let me down for 60 on the group winners accumulator . Tamping
Liar !
Rooney at any time , 3-1 England I fancy price ?
Dynamite .
Lmao quality .
Lmao do n't think I 've ever seen this in my life haha
Absolutely amazing !
Such a dramatic tweeter is our Rachel !
Are you reading the dictionary ? ` Yeah I like to break a mental sweat too '
And I was being cocky right back gaawd
It could be worse ?
Oh never mind then !
So have I ?
Sky are diabolical lately .
Sky Comedy smile
Sky Comedy !
Sky Comedy !
Dodgeball starting as I put the tele on , now that 's what I 'm talking about !
I was thinking that , Carroll and Rooney up top . . Welbeck wide left ?
Sky Sports sources understand Tottenham are in preliminary negotiations with France boss Laurent Blanc . More on site soon . wow
Lmao had to check . Got it in my head now aswell , thanks for that !
It is the rock version you mean and not a remake haha ?
Great tune !
is way too cool to be nearly 30 .
You 've never spoken truer words Carlos !
I had you in mind
How do all the people that no one likes and have no real friends all end up being friends with each other ?
Hope Steve Clarke does well at West Brom , has been one of the best Assistant Managers for a long time now , deserves his chance .
Newcastle away ? 17th November , lets make this happen please ! ?
17th November Newcastle United -LRB- A -RRB- = Big , massive piss up .
Stick to the landline if i were you !
De Buchy has been one of the standout defenders of the Euros , attacking flair matched by his defensive ability . Rarely do FBs posses both
Monday morning you little bitch , you 're like a boomerang . You always come back
Everton home I fancy .
What , sad face ! ?
9am sharp .
They played Frankfurt in their 5th final in a row , and won 7-3 . Puskas with 4 , Di Stefano with 3 . All 30 + too ha
Seen months t of them mate ! this bloke though , wow . Probably my favorite one i 've seen
you must be special ! What a player for Madrid
Watching Di Stefano 's footballs greatest , class act ! 5 European Cups , 8 La Ligas . . and when Charlton and Eusebio call you the best ever 1\/2
How 's the foot treating you ?
I do n't want your sympathy retweet you long-haired imbecile , remember when you said Cardiff like Utd , Swans like Wigan ! ?
My 3\/1 with Germany is looking shrewd at the moment .
Germany winning is all but a habit for them , once again efficient . And again the saying ` Vorsprung Durch Technik ' applies .
Hahahaha
Lukas Podolski has just scored his 45th goal for Germany in his 100th game . He 's just 27 . Amazing .
Months ago brother !
I 'm not defending him by any stretch . . just saying if they win you ca n't blame selection .
Haha , true story ! Enjoy last night mate ?
Winning every game 1-0 = no need to worry about goal difference .
1-0 is the same as 19-0 . 3 points .
If they win , you can . Sorry son
Haha shut up you nutter . If they go 3\/3 it 's justified .
Hahaha fr ulein , you 're a plonker . Hope The Germans top the group and get the Greeks .
Now now !
Sundays are meant for doing fuck all .
Zizou ! Best footballer in the last 20 years bar Messi .
You know you are an easy target when you 're standing on the sideline watching a game and the ref stops it to point you out and abuse you .
Tell your old man to come out he 's more of laugh than you !
Because you 've got time on your hands ?
Jonesey , you must have heard the rumor Laudrup is in for
I 'd have to go on for months haha !
Do n't come up then !
I was impressed , some huge hits too ! No mate I 'm on Herbalife trying to lose weight to look trim in that kit next year ?
My ginger skin would not cope in that ! Wow
Haha , true ! Enjoy yesterday Grav ?
P l droed over Maesteg ?
Bored ! ! ! Haha , repetition just to emphasise how bored you are ! Doing today ?
Neither do I , mind you we probably should have won that game in the 10 minutes .
My dream team should be named ` The Euro underperformers , with Ozil and Schweinsteiger ' . Fuckers
You know me too well Coozey .
3 happy 0pm , the 20 's on again !
Exactly what i said yesterday !
it 's not my birthday , but purely for bragging rights to my mates , answer this . . Bacon or Sausage ?
it 's not my birthday , but purely for bragging rights to my mates , answer this . . Bacon or Sausage ?
I watched Warrior last night , one of the best films I 've ever seen .
I have that effect on women , ca n't help it .
Either being dropped is n't really justified , if one of the best strikers in the world was n't coming into the side .
How I met your mother is amazing too ! But really , him ?
I would never speak to another female again if she gave my any type of attention . I 'd worship her .
My opinion of you has grown ! Kaley Cuoco is a 10 .
Fugy is hammering the toblerones .
Questioned whether I missed you today . Do n't worry , I did n't
Walked in , gave my old man his card and toblerones , which he munches away on . Even got him a sound card with it singing ` daddy cool '
My favorite people I follow I 'd probably hate in real life .
tut tut !
Cheers !
Trying to get one of the boys to drive
What time you leaving ?
You going to watch the broncos today mate ?
Smart . Casual .
Why do ya doubt it Rob ?
Never you mind .

Clichy should play over Evra every day of the week .
The J ger train you mean ! ?
`` The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has limits . '' - Albert Einstein
Sadly , that 's probably true .
What a storm !
Laudrup !
Why do n't you want them ?
Before the Hull game , if someone had have told me Michael Laudrup would be our manager in 7 years , I would have reffered them to cefn coed .
Bet with your head not your heart ! You just know though that England will qualify in 2nd .
For my ` top of the group ' accumulator Jont !
Life 's different at 7 happy 0 ! It 's . . quieter .
at 7:20 ? What a good start you must have had .
they 're representative of dog faeces ! ?
Yeah , I did n't fancy anyone so went for Huntelaar as a long shot .
Would you ever do a drink style man vs food ? Perhaps call it drink vs food
Yeah I know , but he was like saying to me lightning strikes twice and all that . Who you done top scorer ?
My old man had Italy at 16\/1 , he said last time they were in a match fixing scandal they won the world cup haha .
2 from him were n't it ? Done Germany to win the competition , Spain will be hard to beat though .
Had 11\/1 on 4-0 Spain tonight too . Cheeky !
Germans , Spain and Russia looking decent to top their groups , hope England do n't let me down now .
We just given data to ring , ca n't help talking to people like you can we !
Do n't you realize we have commission to make ? You should follow me back too btw
Haha , that 's fair ! What 's wrong with our breed then ?
All chat ! ?
Yo , I 'm telesales folk ! ?
How does a USA bloke come to like ` soccer ? '
