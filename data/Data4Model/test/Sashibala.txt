I 've had my fear of crowds a lot longer than my sexy squishiness . smile
Was just told my ochlophobia would go away if I lost weight and amp ; gained selfconfidence . I replied `` Too bad stupid and amp ; rude stick no matter what . ''

With my leg issues , I 've been less active and amp ; more comfort eating so 20 lbs had crept back . 5 were lost at DS and amp ; 4 more are gone this week . smile
Yep ... : ... another month and not a whole lot to show for it . LOL I 'm still doodling on practically everything ...
Wish I could make it craft night but with Friday 's plan , I ca n't afford the gas to do both . angry I love my van but the gas mileage sucks . playful
I cooked up a storm this weekend , about 11 hours just on Saturday ! Homemade ricotta cheese is the part I am months t proud of from that day . smile
The best part about making awesome dinners ? Leftovers for breakfast ! I have so much brisket left over , too . smile
All homemade by me : beef brisket -LRB- my first -RRB- , twice baked sour cream and amp ; herb taters , and buttered corn . It was so good !
Do you believe the end is near ? No ? You \* should \* ! I just cleaned my kitchen because I \* wanted \* to and not because of expected company .
If you are in a sharing mood , I could use LB discount codes . smile
2\/2 So I can imagine how hard it is to not say anything !
1\/2 There have been a number of times I 've found out after breaking up with someone that my friends could n't stand him\/her .
I want to shout from the rooftops how very much in love with him I am but since he needs me to be discreet , I 'll just whisper it instead . smile
Yayayay ! Though you \* DID \* RSVP already ; -RRB-
I get to leave early for a necessary but dreaded dr appt and then it 's tonight ! Lots of maybes so it may or may not be a large group .
Sweet ! Thanks for letting me know ! smile
