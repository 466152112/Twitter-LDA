Spending a relaxing evening ... editing knitting patterns . rrwell do what you love , right ?
aw , yay new flatmate !
like getting hired by interpol ?
Sigh . Worst nightmare . Trying to hunt down source of dozens and amp ; dozens of spiders in my room last night ...
Sewing buttonholes by hand takes SO LONG . But I refuse to give up my treadle sewing machine in favor of gadgets ...
Sigh . Chick tracts are also ... so dang ugly . If art is a window to the soul ...
Just heard the best political term . `` Republocrats . '' Not one party , or the other , exactly .
Squeee ! It 's a studio day !
I ca n't believe I never heard of slushpilehell before now !
I swear green is a neutral , so the answer is - probably .
you arrived , though ! Fully alive ! and I had Dad coaching me all the way back , too .
I think I might be jealous that you 're going to master a stick shift .
Just tried out some moonshine ... uh ... let 's just say I think it killed my sore throat .
Biked home from work today ! I think that means I can genuinely relax tonight . Not even knitting work on the agenda .
You look so cute with short hair !
I SO heart those movies and the people in them !
ahahahaha ... Greg just suggested Mrs. Pacman !
Daisy , Princess Tomato , Samus is n't a princess , but could have a sexy armor thing going on .
I have always though Mario princesses would be better for some burlesque , too . happy
The Olympics are on a roll with dissing fiber artists , are n't they ?
of course , if you keep thinking of things like portal burlesque , I wo n't be able to keep from giggling all day . happy
thanks ! and the same back to you ! especially the energy part .
Gooood morning twitter world . Today I 'm -LRB- a -RRB- interning -LRB- b -RRB- working AND -LRB- c -RRB- teaching . Wish me energy .
lol . 20doz . does n't guarantee that you 'll never make an awkward gender mistake ... laugh
aha ! I knew it ! There 's a second ret knitter inside you !
I know ! Let 's make Ravelympics more like the original Olympics ... by knitting in the nude ! Do you think trademarked nudity ?
I LOVE DangerMouse 's blue steel look ! That 's a winner .
Is that like when I was yelling at my husband that a church randomly decided to start changing the nicene creed 's wording ?
On a positive note : mastered enough stick shift to get us back from Indiana today - did n't stall out once !
If anyone else is mad enough to boycott ...
I got to say , your insulting letter re : Ravelympics makes you into more of a joke than the knitting did ... and it was so rude .
Squea ! I love the DC metro rap ! Profoundly grateful I do n't have to suffer through it , though ...
Whaaaaaaat ? `` Ravelympics '' infringes the Olympics IP ?
Stewed crackers for lunch !
Quick PSA : No , you can not use buttermilk to make whipped cream .
Uh-oh . I have remembered where I hit the peanut butter chips . And I just finished carving a block , so ... reward time ?
Every now and then I hear a sudden pounding on a window . Turns out it 's Dad trying to scare grackles away from the bird feeder .
Let 's turn this day around with ... carving some new blocks .
Tuesday : make toast . Swear at printer . Only today 's Wednesday .
You are very accomplished !
Surprise fancy picnic !
I 'm thinking that 's got to be a natural constant of some kind . One that results in an automatic unsubscribe .
Calculate the grossness of past coworkers posting photos of their working-out significant others -LRB- including their lascivious commentary -RRB- .
I think I 'm going to try and call it quits around 9 tonight , and relax a little . Plan ? Plan .
Barons of Tea update .
Good ! work , work , work . happy
Is your Monday going OK ? From the food photos , it looks like you conquered the weekend 's challenges .
Hm . Thanks . Maybe I just need wider audiobook interests . happy
Do you get audio books through library ? Have been considering audible but do n't know anyone who 's used it .
such a cute kitty !
Oh man , it is so sad to see Furyk crashing and burning on the last few holes . After holding the lead for days !
Ryder cup ? It 's a good thing commentators do n't have to spell on air .
Rider Cup ! That one has points and different tea Ms ...
Just tried to search for Kingler on facebook .
I al months t never find golf entertaining . But here 's a commentator gem : `` I 've learned one thing . When you 're in trouble , get out of trouble . ''
Got Dad some smoking chips for his grill ... and now he 's making pork chops !
just saw your reading chair tweet ... have always wanted a chaise lounge-ish chair to read in !
At least judging from my 4 years of customer service experience .
I bet they send unsubscribe emails because people email them saying `` Did I really get unsubscribed ? I have n't heard from you ... ''
I 'm also trying to cook my way into being a good daughter . Hiccups ensue .
so jealous of your shawarma dinner !
Ugh . Dreamt that I hauled suitcases through three train stations , an airport , and a grocery store last night . My brain hates me .
btw , do you do french press coffee at your house ?
those only count as spoilers if you already know what the hell is going on ... which I do n't .
Dear lovely internet people . Will you bring me a cheeseburger the next time we hang out ?
not poets , that 's for sure .
Um ... another terrible medical name ... there 's a low-friction catheter called Lofric . Pronounced low-frick .
Sewing is theoretically so much faster than knitting . But I ca n't say I enjoy it like I enjoy knitting .
If we ever have to buy another car , we 're getting it from Brubaker . Cars around here are so dang expensive .

Just as soon as I am done making it for this art collection .
Just finished Three-Seeded Mercury dress ! It fits ! And is beautiful ! And I will totally make that pattern again for personal wear .
oooooh , yes . I could see the resemblance to LPW .
you so win !
SO many yay !
which man ?
It cracks me up when I hear husband summarizing my opinions . He knows me so well .
you win ! Yay for medicines !
Not `` oh good , '' but so good that there 's medicine for that , at least !
Strawberry Delight for breakfast ! I 'm sure it 's as unhealthy as a donut . But man , it is fabulous .
That 's right . Biked home today like a boss . Fended off migraine with caffeine and tylenol . Next up , will accompli-zzzzzzz zzzzz zzzzz .

My name means `` son of a great warrior . '' oops .
Let me know what you think about the movie after you do see it . Curious since you 're more comics and amp ; anime oriented than me .
I hope you love it ! Picking strawberries and amp ; jamming is one of my favorite parts of the year .
Howl is very much an anime film , and the book is very much British YA lit . But both are awesome .
yeah , keeping them apart is good . One of the few movies-from-books that I do n't hate ... but they 're so very different .
strawberry jam ? It is one of the super easy ones and so fabulous .
hugs for the day . Is Howl 's Moving Castle today ? Did you like the book ?
Repeat after me : I should not be up this early . I should not be having a migraine aura .
unfortunately , I think the design of it is kind of ugly ! But you ca n't have everything , and not everyone is a designer .
have you ever played Dominion ? Card game with LOTS of permutations that we really love .
I 'll tell him you liked it ! He also loved that there is a real Sasquatch Acre .
That 's AMAZING . My husband loves that there is a real place called Sasquatch Acre !
my husband thinks Sasquatch lives in Portland and amp ; runs a farm , so he made this illustration .
I kind of internally squee at the thought of you in giant fighting reptile form . Sounds like a good day !
So apparently they do n't ALL want to talk to their mothers in public . happy
Ooh ! I have to tell you one of our NYC clients ' best quotes : `` Not even my mutha gets my cell phone numbah from you . ''
One sweater all finished and amp ; ready to go back to its maker ! I feel like the queen of mattress stitch .
OH MY GOSH . IT 'S WORLD-WIDE KNIT IN PUBLIC DAY AND I 'M J USA T STAYING AT HOME . WHERE DID I GO WRONG ?
I read that as `` walked to Belfast . '' Breakfast seems more manageable .
yes , video chat would be lovely
I miss you ! I was remembering how fun it was to see you and and Liz in Lancaster !
I ca n't remember what my old linkedin password was , though - hm . Suppose it 's not important if I have n't used in 3 years .
haha , your linkedin passwords make me giggle .
Sew sew sew . I have vague expectations that this dress will actually fit me .
TADA ! Finished getting curriculum together for class tomorrow night . I 'm out to make every knitter love their crochet hook .
I ca n't imagine what it would be like to try and debunk quacks for a living ... stressful .
I hope rural PA is treating you to relaxation ! I wish we could still drive over to see you !
Holy dump . How did you find this appalling bleach enema ... shit ?
-LRB- blog -RRB- kickstarter : more exciting than the kentucky derby ?
I am so going to steal that trick -LRB- thinking velociraptors during blood draw -RRB- . I keep getting sick when needled .
I also completed bonus mission : eat the cookies . No points were gained for this . Only useless calories .
Mission completed . Youngest brother rescued from destitute country airport , installed at home .
LOVE the contessa with squid print ! Sleep sweet !
Or do you buy it ? Maybe I 'm just cynical .
I 'm not just sure that would realistically be the biggest internal problem of protagonist in that situation .
And for this evening 's trick , we will remember to pick up our younger brother at the airport at 10 pm .
I 'm team `` please let 's have a YA best-seller without a love triangle next time . ''
So excited ! Husband launched kickstarter for his board game. , Barons of Tea . . and he has backers already !
Husband 's very last teapot drawing ! Henry VIII anyone ?
so I feel less bad about my failure to sew them correctly . And a blazer , well , I salute your bravery . happy
I always end upset when I try to sew a Burda pattern ... someone was telling me they 're probably translated from German ?
you and ProfX are both titans . Titans .
Averoigne story idea !
OK . Maybe it 's the goofy ones that are my favorites . Any Willy Wonka fans out there ? A blueberry teapot just for you .
Hm , also really liked the yeti teapot .
I do have to say the the Crow teapot and Tom Servo were some of my faves .
Ca n't believe it 's already day 100 of 100 days of Teapots ! -LRB- drawn by my husband -RRB-
Ah , close to full moon . that explains the crazies that showed up at the yarn store . Though to be fair , knitters ARE very ... individual .
knock yourself out ! -LRB- maybe then you wo n't have to grade at all , meta or non-meta-lly ? -RRB-
hah . Be safe . Tornadoes scary .
did you get the scarlet H in high school or college ? I do n't remember that .
haha , `` The Great White Worm '' made me laugh out loud . Do it . Totally write that one .
