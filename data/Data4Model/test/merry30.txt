Is it any good ? I remember it being good , but do n't know if I 'm rose-tinted
I do ! Though had forgotten its title - was trying to talk about it to someone a couple of weeks ago - met with blankness .
Lots of luck for today -LRB- hope I 'm not too late -RRB- -LRB- got distracted by yoga -RRB-
Wow , well done ! That was quick . -LRB- The smell of toast probably did it ... -RRB-
Am tempted to also have emergency nachos . The pub down the hill does lovely nachos ...
Damn damn damn damn damn . Transcription software has fallen over . DAMMIT .
Lovely to meet you too . Hope the journey goes smoothly !
Congratulations - and condolences . A nice memorial for your grandfather , though .
Yes - I only have Radio 4 to go on , but it seems that it 's the history norm now .
I have n't quite got my head round the CE thing , to be honest .
Have sent DM .
Hurrah for successful presentation ! Also , you 're in Aber ? ! Have you got time to meet up for a coffee ?
Spent five minute pomodoro break racking brain for possible amusing F and amp ; R results . Utterly failed . Back to transcription ...
You should have tweeted it . We 're imagining things which are -LRB- probably -RRB- worse now ...
Day 5 of wading through treacle .
Any particular reason ? Have I missed something ?
Could someone please go and rip out whatever bit of wiring is causing that car alarm to go off ? Eight times is seven times too many .
Me either .
Your recent tweets are making me seriously reconsider choosing Smile as my new bank ...
It 's good that you care . But you really do need to put yourself first , especially when you 're poorly .
Good luck !
But is it true ?
Oh poor you . I think you might have to reconsider work tomorrow ...
rrwell if anyone needs a declaration of faith or affirmation , it 's people schlepping to the end of a PhD ...
You could still give someone a nasty poke with them -LRB- and keep poking until they meet your demands -RRB- -LRB- for extra peanuts -RRB-
Still , I have complete faith in you . I 'm sure that does n't help , but .
True . Though being full time wo n't last much longer - have to find a job soon ...
You 're further on than I am . And I 'm aiming for first full draft by end of year .
Hurrah ! Well done !
That 's an improvement , though , is n't it ? Little steps ...
I understand . Though it 's been a while since I 've been able to ...
Dear unknown men , If you M USA T slam car doors and rev your engine outside my house , please do n't do it at 6:50 am on a Saturday . No love , Me .
That 's a good sign !
I knew him from the -LRB- Branagh -RRB- Wallander - though it took ages to realize that was where ...
To be honest , anything 's possible with The Mother . Though I 'll probably just have sore feet and either sunburn or hypothermia .
Oh , wish I could . Will actually be in England that weekend , but recovering from day at wildlife park for mother 's 73rd birthday .
I 'll put it on my ` definitely ' list then ... smile
Always good - soc capital is such a massive thing I can feel a bit lost ! Tho it does mean you can usually find what you need ...
-LRB- jumping in -RRB- Can you let me know what the Field Social Capital book is like ? It 's on my ` maybe ' list ...
Congratulations . Should we kneel ? Or just call you ` Sir ' ?
I had to teach mine penguin .
Ha ha brilliant ! I watched it a couple of weeks ago and agree with thesis whisperer jr. . Good fun , needs a remake .
Nope . But thanks to a visit to the gym it 's now in a remix with Never Can Say Goodbye by the Communards .
Can anyone explain to me why my earworm for the past two days has been ` Jerusalem ' ? No ? Me either ...
The nastier the medicine , the better it is .
I always thought it was a man . Do n't know why . Interesting ...
Top moment of the day : John Humphrys ' noise of disgust at guest 's use of the historical present . Marvellous !
The first series was worse .
Flax yarn ?
rrwell you asked . And I have Plans ...
Beer , a phillips head screwdriver , and a raspberry pavlova . And a wicker log basket .
... and now I 've wasted about half an hour pootling around infographics on mashable and amp ; pinterest ...
Ta muchly ... !
That 's my experience too . Most wanted to see PhD or any articles , but hardly anyone wanted to see their transcript .
: : moody face : : I have leftover pasta for lunch . : : more moody face : :
Exactly ! Most said at time of interview that they wd n't want to see the transcript . And it 's been a while , so ...
No I mean checking the transcript for accuracy etc. . -LRB- Proper term is respondent validation . Forgot it earlier ... -RRB-
I recommend Die Hard . Or Hot Fuzz . -LRB- I nearly always recommend Die Hard or Hot Fuzz . -RRB-
Qualitative folk : If you used participant checking , did all your participants want to ? Or did you not give them a choice ?
You 're allowed . : : hug : :
smile
That sounds ... intriguing .
Can you treat yourself to a spirits-lifting lunch with a chum ? Or an evening of cheesy films and pizza ?
Oh , that 's a rubbish way to start the day . I hope your skies clear soon ...
Sounds like it was a very thorough supervision ! How do you feel about it ? Are you okay about making changes ?
Ah I see . No , I think that 's fine . Shows what you 've achieved even if it 's not all gone exactly as planned . 1\/2
Ditto Persuasion -LRB- my favorite Austen -RRB- . I 'd definitely stay in all day for that .
No. . Why ? -LRB- Not sure I entirely understand the question ... -RRB-
Am free . Just tell me a time -LRB- or text me on the day , when you 're done -RRB- . With any luck there 'll be cake left !
Not bad . Transcribing like a mad lady . Knitting wrist warmers . Spinning very thin yarn . The usual ... Fancy a beer sometime ?
I like it roasted myself . But have tried beetroot chocolate cake and it was very nice .
Also I remember a River Cottage episode with beetroot ice cream ...
Beetroot and chocolate cake ? Nigella had a recipe for that I think ...
And ? Did it work ?
Doddle . : : ducks and runs away : :
`` I 'm writing last chapter '' ... : : envious face : :
I \* know \* ! I 've always wanted to work there ...
Haha - is `` That people can be MEAN '' an appropriate answer ?
Hi - no , we and all our friends were lucky . All very horrid though , and amp ; the sight of ruined belongings piled on the streets very sad .
Much as I hate to link to the Daily Fail , this is marvellous :
Levels of doubt , maybe ?
Crammed full of transcription ! With occasional editing\/writing , hopefully . Yours ?
Ahoy , both !
Not much use if not high wool content tho -LRB- have bags of not-wool donated by mother -RRB- .
Yes I can see that smile . Was pondering non-knot joining and found video of spit splicing . Every day 's a school day ...
I have a newbie question re this : why would n't you leave the knot in ?
Oh , thank \* heavens \* . Done . Rather more inaudible words than I 'd rrlike but at least it 's done . Now , I 'm sure I saw wine earlier ...
Well I 'm certainly not going to start another one today ! My reward will be knitting - if I get it done before bedtime !
Thank God it 's only 24 minutes long . And I 'm at 14 minutes .
Oh , this transcription is driving me crazy . It 's taking AGES . Noisy location , unclear participant ... Ca n't wait for it to be over .
smile
Hurrah well done !
Hurrah , coffee . Also found a jaffa cake .
Am struggling to get my transcription mojo working this pm . Am even having -LRB- rare -RRB- chocolate craving . Maybe coffee will help ...
Oh yay ! Well done ! ! Congratulations , Dr. Dobson !
Hurrah well done - fingers crossed for tomorrow !
- can anyone give examples of dedicated res student spaces away from depts which have been or not been successful ?
It 's not actually that bad if you consider that a minute can take 6-10 mins to transcribe . If 6 , it 's only min wage
Practicality is important . Do the green 's creases fall out when hung\/worn ?
The material looks stiffer -LRB- thus more formal ? -RRB- than the purple . -LRB- And I did n't think it looked like a sofa at all . -RRB-
Ah . Not a look you favor for BIALL , I guess ?
Hard to tell on hangers but for me tis between green and amp ; purple . But my heart says purple . As red does n't seem to be an option .
And a wrist support for the RSI from endless transcription . -LRB- I 'm not quite there yet , but it 's close ... -RRB-
My supervisor and I are wearing matching outfits today . -LRB- Except she has pretty pink toenails and I 'm wearing socks . -RRB-
Does your IT policy allow access to Delicious or Pinboard or other similar thing ?
And come with a different outfit of warm jumper and fingerless gloves for typing .
Graduate Student Barbie . Ca n't decide if it 's quite funny or quite depressing -
Also , always worth asking on the Moodle board for referencing . Peter 's usually v quick to answer . Also , other students help .
Portsmouth has brilliant resources ! ! -LRB- Makes Aber look a bit rubbish in comparison . -RRB-
It 's a bit of a minefield smile I 'm a bit weird and really love referencing -LRB- with o software -RRB- , but am in a minority I think .
I 'm pretty sure you use the website date i.e. the date given for the website at the time when you saw it there .
Very hairy . We 've been lucky , but have friends in the worst-hit places . Luckily the sun is out today , but more rain forecast frown
Bryman and Creswell are my favorite methods texts . Straightforward and comprehensive .
No problem . Needs all the retweets it can get I think ...
Oh dear ... Now I 'm glad that I had n't got around to joining LinkedIn ...
Should the word `` tweet '' be capitalized ?
I think I 'd have to PAY to have a supervision on a bank holiday !
On a bank holiday ? Am impressed .
So have I missed Tom Jones ?
'' Always been confused : it isn t really in this ever-changing world in which we live in is it ? '' I really REALLY hope not .
Please do n't do Hey Jude ...
The projection on the palace during Our House was absolutely brilliant . So clever .
Why is being awake at six thirty on a Saturday like a pig 's tail ? Because it 's twirly !
I have been utterly rubbish at so far today . I need to get back on the transcription wagon this afternoon
I 'm so , so sorry for your loss . My thoughts and prayers are with you and your family .
